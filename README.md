# Beam Analysis Tool
A single-page web application that analyzes common beam-load scenarios and
reports their results such as maximum demands as well as plots of shear and
moment diagrams.


## Tools and Technologies
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org)

## About
A prototype web application written with React and D3.js that reports common
values such as maximum shear and moment demands for beams under common loading
conditions. It also generates shear and moment diagrams with a tooltip that
queries values along the length of the beam.
